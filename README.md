[Delphi Custom Containers Pack](https://osdn.net/projects/ccpack)
=============================

Delphi Custom Containers Pack (CCPack) is an integrated tool and component mini-library to produce and maintain composite controls (or simply “composites”) and other containers (forms, data modules and frames). The process of building composite components looks like ActiveForm and Frame creating, but the result is a native VCL component. You can create new composites just as usual forms.

It was originally developed for Delphi 5 and updated to support Delphi 7 by [Sergey Orlik](http://cc.embarcadero.com/Author/654) who posted the source code to [code central](http://edn.embarcadero.com/search?q=ccpack&allsites=y&allwords=y&x=0&y=0). (His homepage is no longer available, but it has [been archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20030413205833/http://www.geocities.com:80/SiliconValley/Way/9006/) on [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).)
